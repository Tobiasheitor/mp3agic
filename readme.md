# mp3agic

Simple algoritm used to rename music files with track metadata.
 The algorithm will read the meta tags of the track (name and author) and rename them in the format: "name - author".
 The algorithm is configured for .mp3 files, but can be easily changed in the 'RenameFile' class (available in the 'com.mpatric.impl' package).

## How to run the algorithm

 *Consider having Java installed.
 Use an IDE like Eclipse to generate executable .jar.
 Open the IDE, right click on the project, Export, Java, Runnable JAR File, select the directory and finish.
 To execute put the .jar in the desired folder and in two clicks, if the java is installed it will work.
